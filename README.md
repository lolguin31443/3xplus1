I honestly couldnt be fucked to make a calculator that will keep going untill it finds a number that does not go back to 1 because i am not 
a programer i am a masochist who likes giving myself an inconsevable goal along the lines of "learn to build any kind of program in c#"
or "learn all the types of math you need to become a partical physisit" so sure i may be able to make basic BS like what you see here but 
its never gonna get better than that
